For this homework assignment I implemented a database program using
a vector. The requirements that I have implemented consider of
adding a new student, removing a student, editing a student,
getting a student by id which prints the student, editing a student.
When editing a student you will be asked to edit the first
and last name because the two names are stored as one strong. One thing
that you can not edit is the id. Student ids are automatically generated
and are random. I do not use the array index as an id, becuase the id was said
to be 9 digits long. I also implemented the ability to get
students by year. For this case please have the capitalize the year
to get all the students of that year. I also implemented the ability
to save the database, and load the database to a file. I have include
an database.txt file to test the program with students in them already.
Also, when loading the database or saving the file, please provide the full
path to the file and make sure the file has already been created for it to
work correctly. I tried multiple times and ways to save to a file that was
not created but it did not work, therefore the latter has to be done.

I created this program in the QT creater editor. To compile and run the program,
you have to use the .pro which is in this zip file. The program that you want to open is the StudentRecords folder inside the hw2 folder. I also implemented many other
features that checked for proper values and input, which i think should be considered
in my grading.

Someways that I think this program could be made more efficient, is to store the
database as a tree structure, to allow for faster lookups. I also think that
id's should be by index, which could then allow for constant lookup.

I hope you enjoy using my program, and find it easy to use.
